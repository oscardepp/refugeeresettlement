## Introduction
This project assists refugee resettlement given a large-scale disaster in the world in a two-part, comprehensive model. The first part asks: a natural disaster hits a particular country: can we predict how many people will be displaced from their homes? In which the second part follows: given a proportion of those who are displaced, what are suitable locations to which they relocate in that country? Our model uses natural disasters and settlements in Lebanon to assess the damage, but the features and methodology could be easily generalized and abstracted to construct a more ubiquitous and robust framework.
